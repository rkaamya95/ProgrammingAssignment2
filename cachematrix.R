## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## The below function creates a special vector which is a list containing functions to set the value of vector, 
## get the value of vector, set the value of inverse and to get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {


}


## The below function calculates the inverse of the matrix and returns it. It checks if the inverse has already been calculates. 
## If yes, then it returns the cached value, else calculates the inverse

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {

}
